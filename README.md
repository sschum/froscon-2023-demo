You can start the application like this:
```shell
./start.sh
```
This will build a docker image and run a container. After that you can watch the result: **http://localhost:1312**

## start - without docker

If you dont have or you dont want to use docker, you can open the index.html in your browser: **file://PROJECT_DIR/index.html**
